# Overview
Welcome, researcher! The Neuroimaging Hub aims to support investigators interested in brain development with resources and experience to ensure rigor and innovation in the field of neuroimaging. Our 3T MRI is located at the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain (MIDB). While not located at CMRR, 3TD still follows all [CMRR policies and procedures](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/policies/){:target="_blank"} for safety and operation. In this section we will go over some of the more frequently asked questions by teams getting started with neuroimaging and training to operate the MRI.

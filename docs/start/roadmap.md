## Requesting Neuroimaging Hub Assistance at MIDB
[Research engagement requests](https://midb.umn.edu/research-services/engage-midb-service-hubs/process-engagement-request){:target="_blank"} are filled out on the MIDB website. If your project has multiple facets in need of assistance, requests for service can include [multiple Hubs!](../start/midb-over.md){:target="_blank"} Once the request is received and approved, a project manager will be assigned and reach out about scheduling a technical meeting. Technical meetings include the PI, study team, and specialists from the requested Hubs to address questions, deliverables, and timelines for the project. Sometimes requests for multiple Hubs may need additional attention, in these cases technical meetings with each Hub may be necessary.

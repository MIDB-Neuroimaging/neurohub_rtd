# Roadmap to a Successful Study


## Required Approvals for Research with Human Subjects
- **Register with CMRR**
    - Follow [this link](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/access/){:target="_blank"} to login or register with CMRR as a new user.
        - For more in-depth assistance, please see our [CMRR page.](../cmrr/user.md){:target="_blank"}

    - Please complete [this application](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/preirb/){:target="_blank"} prior to submitting to the IRB

- **IRB Approval**
    - The [International Review Board (IRB)](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb){:target="_blank"} oversees research projects involving human participants to ensure ethical and uncoerced approaches are taken for participant safety.

- **PARS Approval**
    - All projects using CMRR resources must submit an [application for resources.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/newuser/pars_overview.php){:target="_blank"}

## Requesting Neuroimaging Hub Assistance at MIDB
[Research engagement requests](https://midb.umn.edu/research-services/engage-midb-service-hubs/process-engagement-request){:target="_blank"} are filled out on the MIDB website. If your project has multiple facets in need of assistance, requests for service can include [multiple Hubs!](../start/midb-over.md){:target="_blank"} Once the request is received and approved, a project manager will be assigned and reach out about scheduling a technical meeting. Technical meetings include the PI, study team, and specialists from the requested Hubs to address questions, deliverables, and timelines for the project. Sometimes requests for multiple Hubs may need additional attention, in these cases technical meetings with each Hub may be necessary.

## CMRR Access
General building access can be granted after registering with CMRR and completing the following trainings:
- CMRR Safety Training: Basic
- Radiation Safety Orientation
- Introduction to Research Safety
- Chemical Safety
- Blood Borne Pathogen Training
In addition to this list, Human MR access requires the following trainings:
- CMRR Safety Training:Advanced 
- CMRR Safety Training: Human

While these trainings are not required for CMRR building access, they will be needed to be completed by study team members conducting reserch with human participants:
- HIPAA
- CITI Training
A full list of trainings can be found on the [CMRR Safety page.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/safety/){:target="_blank"} These trainings can also be found on the [University Training Hub](https://training.umn.edu/){:target="_blank"} website.
More information on CMRR access can be found on our [CMRR Access page.](../cmrr/user.md){:target="_blank"}

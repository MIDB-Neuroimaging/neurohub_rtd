# Roadmap to a Successful Study


## Required Approvals for Research with Human Subjects
- **Register with CMRR**
    - Follow [this link](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/access/){:target="_blank"} to login or register with CMRR as a new user.
        - For more in-depth assistance, please see our [CMRR page.](../cmrr/user.md){:target="_blank"}

- **Pre-IRB review**
    - Please complete [this application](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/preirb/){:target="_blank"} prior to submitting to the IRB

- **IRB Approval**
    - The [International Review Board (IRB)](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb){:target="_blank"} oversees research projects involving human participants to ensure ethical and uncoerced approaches are taken for participant safety.

- **PARS Approval**
    - All projects using CMRR resources must submit an [application for resources.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/newuser/pars_overview.php){:target="_blank"}

## Requesting Neuroimaging Hub Assistance at MIDB
[Research engagement requests](https://midb.umn.edu/research-services/engage-midb-service-hubs/process-engagement-request){:target="_blank"} are filled out on the MIDB website. If your project has multiple facets in need of assistance, requests for service can include [multiple Hubs!](../start/midb-over.md){:target="_blank"} Once the request is received and approved, a project manager will be assigned and reach out about scheduling a technical meeting. Technical meetings include the PI, study team, and specialists from the requested Hubs to address questions, deliverables, and timelines for the project. Sometimes requests for multiple Hubs may need additional attention, in these cases technical meetings with each Hub may be necessary.

## CMRR Access

### General Building Access
General building access can be granted after registering with CMRR and completing the following trainings:

- CMRR Safety Training: Basic
- Radiation Safety Orientation
- Introduction to Research Safety
- Chemical Safety
- Blood Borne Pathogen Training

### MRI Room Access
In addition to this list, Human MR access requires the following trainings:

- CMRR Safety Training: Advanced 
- CMRR Safety Training: Human

While these trainings are not required for CMRR building and MRI room access, they will be needed to be completed by study team members conducting reserch with human participants:

- HIPAA
- CITI Training

A full list of trainings can be found on the [CMRR Safety page.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/safety/){:target="_blank"} These trainings can also be found on the [University Training Hub](https://training.umn.edu/){:target="_blank"} website.
More information on CMRR access can be found on our [CMRR Access page.](../cmrr/user.md){:target="_blank"}

## Operator Training
Operator training is required to sit first chair and conduct scans on any CMRR MRI. In addition to the training courses listed above, researchers must complete an on-site safety course and 3T operator training course at CMRR.

!!!note
    To operate the 3T-D scanner at MIDB, you must first schedule a 3T-D orientation with a Neuroimaging Specialist.

More information on operator trainings can be found on our [CMRR Human Research Training page.](../cmrr/operator.md){:target="_blank"}

## Getting Access to MIDB
### Building Access
To gain building access to MIDB please fill out the [Employee/Student Access Form.](https://facilities.umn.edu/our-services/research-facility-support-services-rfss/rfss-building-access/rfss-research-building){:target="_blank"} Once filled out please notify your PI as well as your MIDB project manager. If you do not have a lead project manager from one of the research hubs at MIDB please [submit a research engagement request.](https://midb.umn.edu/research-services/engage-midb-service-hubs/process-engagement-request){:target="_blank"} If you've already submitted an engagement request, please email midbresearch@umn.edu.

### 3T-D Access
Once you have completed the CMRR required training, email your training record to Jon Lem (lem00006@umn.edu), the CMRR Facilities Coordinator, and request 3T-D access. CC the PI(s) on the study + Steve Nelson (smnelson@umn.edu), the Neuroimaging Core Director. Your safety trainings will be reviewed, and if the online trainings are completed Jon will refer you to our Project Manager. They will schedule your 3T-D orientation with a tech.

### 3T-D Orientation
The orientation takes between 25-30 minutes, and gives users an overview of the safety procedures at MIDB as they may differ from CMRR.

!!!note
    The 3T-D orientation must be completed before users are given card access to the magnet room. This includes second chair operators or anyone planning to spend time in the magnet room.

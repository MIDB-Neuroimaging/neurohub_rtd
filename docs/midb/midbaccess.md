# MIDB Access
To scan human subjects, researchers must be 3T Operator Certified through CMRR. 

To gain access to the imaging suite, researchers must complete the online safety trainings required by CMRR. [See CMRR Access.](../cmrr/user.md){:target="_blank"}

!!! note
    To spend any time in the magnet control rooms, researchers must be Magnet Safety Trained through CMRR. This requirement includes second chair operators.

Once you have completed the required training, email your training record to Jon Lem (lem00006@umn.edu), the CMRR Facilities Coordinator, and request 3T-D access. CC the PI(s) on the study + Steve Nelson (smnelson@umn.edu), the Neuroimaging Core Director.

## Scheduling 3T-D or Mock Scanner

To book either the 3T-D or Mock Scanner, please use the [CMRR calendar.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/sysadmin/database2/myview2.php?page=week&resource=132){:target="_blank"}
!!! note
    The CMRR calendar must be used for all piloting, set-up, and tear-down time.

If your study is using CNBD space, please see [CNBD Access.](cnbd.md){:target="_blank"}


## Masking and Sanitization Policy

# At The Console

!!! tip
    Best practice is to “Restart System” before beginning your session. 

Protocol trees should follow the convention:

- Region: PI Last Name
- Exam: Project Identifier (e.g., MXXX)
- Protocol: (e.g., Pilot, Final)

Registering Participants:

- Never include PHI/PII (e.g., participant’s name or their day/month of birth)
- Birthdate should be entered as 1/1/[birth year]
- Enter accurate height and weight

## Handling Data
!!! tip
    MIDB studies should push/export data to Naxos. 

!!! warning
    - Data should not be considered protected at the console. 
    - Space is limited and data should be considered at high risk for being overwritten.  


Always export your data when your session is over AND check that it arrived. Double check that all scans made it in case of partial transfer. For more information see [Navigating to Naxos.](../cmrr/naxos.md){:target="_blank"}

### Export Data to CD/DVD
A portable DVD burner is in the control room (it's on the shelf above the mac) that can be plugged into the console tower. Extra CDs are also in the control room.

## Incidental Findings
If you happen to run into any incidental findings during a scan, please follow these steps:

1. Export the structural data (T1, T2) to FV_PACS.
2. Please be aware that if your scan was acquired using only one orientation (typically in the sagittal plane), you will need to reformat at least one of your 3D acquisitions in the other two directions before you send the data to PACS.
3. Submit a radiologist scan review request.
4. When submitting your request please note the following:
    - Location/Event ID (this is the CMRR Calendar Event #)
    - Anonymized Patient Name (This MUST match what was typed into the patient name field on the MRI scanner or it will stop the process)
    - Pertinent Clinical History
    - Description of MRI Series Sent
    - Select a Body Part from the drop down
    - Questions for reviewer (if any)

5. Send email to CMMR technologists Matt White and Wendy Elvendahl (whit3045@umn.edu, welvenda@umn.edu) letting them know a request has been entered.
6. If the Radiologist indicates that clinical follow-up is warranted you must contact the subject to relay that information and you must log back into the radiologist scan review system to confirm that the subject has been contacted.


## Housekeeping

The Control Room can become cluttered very easily. Participants should utilize lockers in the change rooms for their belongings. Researchers should minimize personal belongings in the control room as much as possible. 

Please leave the Magnet Room neat and tidy for the next user. Put away all foams, head coils, and peripheral equipment. White linens should be deposited in the marked bins. 

Garbage and recycling will not be collected from the Control Room. If you are the last scan of the day, please move the bins to the Waiting Area outside the Control Room.

!!! note
    Report any broken or missing equipment to Kim Weldon (kweldon@umn.edu) or Jess Emerick (emeri036@umn.edu) so that it can be replaced or repaired ASAP.

# Data Transfer and Sharing Tools

## Moving data around

### Tier 1 (disk) <-> Tier 2 (s3)

Data can be transferred between Tier 1 and Tier 2 via the s3cmd command - [details here](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-second-tier-storage-command-line).

### Tier 1 (disk) <--> Local storage

Your UMN computer has a local storage space that you may want to use for working on specific files. You can transfer files between local and MSI Tier 1 systems via [winSCP](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-winscp-transfer-data) or [FileZilla](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-filezilla-transfer-data)

### Globus

Globus is a file transfer service that has encrypted services for transmitting large-scale data between institutions. Visit UMN's [starting guide](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-globus-transfer-data-msi-0) for information on setting up Globus for transferring data to and from MSI servers.

# Using MSI

## Permissions

To ensure the data and code created can be accessed by all, update you bashrc with the following steps:

- Open your bashrc file with a text editor
  - emacs ~/.bashrc
- Set umask to 0007
- Close the file and type "source ~/.bashrc" info the terminal to apply the changes

## Code

Code will be saved the the msi in a central location where everyone can access it

**Folder organization**: The folder “code” will have two directories: internal and external. Each directory will have subdirectories for different types of code (analyses, utilities, etc). Repos (example FRF, fconn anova) will live in each folder. See example below taken from rushmore at ohsu
Current folder structure via tree command:

Stewardship is defined in the following table:  
*NOTE: Steward is responsible for keeping the code updated and making sure folder permissions are not chaged after updating code.*

## Data

To optimize computing resources the MSI offers two types of [storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/storage-allocations): [High Performance Storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/high-performance-storage) and [Second Tier Storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/second-tier-storage). Data in the High Performance Storage is backed up and is accessible from all MSI system. Big data is stored in the Second Tier. Data for each particular project can be found on each PI’s space, depending on who leads each particular project. This table (make a md table describing ) summarizes the existing datasets in the DCAN.

DCAN’s High Performance Storage data is located here:

- **/panfs/roc/groups/8/faird/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/miran045/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/feczk001/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/rando149/shared/data**  

DCAN’s storage can also be accessed from MSI using the following shortcuts:

- **/home/faird/shared/data**  
- **/home/miran045/shared/data**  
- **/home/feczk001/shared/data**  
- **/home/rando149/shared/data**

Our group has access to 480 TB of Second Tier Storage.  
Requests to save data on primary or secondary storage must be submitted to DCAN leadership. For more information on transferring data between storage locations, visit our data tranfer pages within this Read the Docs page.

## Projects

Specific projects where derived measures are extracted from data (see above) and analyses are conducted can be found in respective projects folders:

- /home/faird/shared/projects
- /home/miran045/shared/projects
- /home/feczk001/shared/projects

Current active prohects are listed below for each subfolder:

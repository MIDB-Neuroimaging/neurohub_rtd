#The Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR)

## About CMRR

The CMRR focuses on development of unique magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methodologies and instrumentation for the acquisition of structural, functional, and biochemical information non-invasively in humans, and utilizing this capability to investigate organ function in health and disease. The distinctive feature of this center is the emphasis on ultrahigh magnetic fields (7 Tesla (T) and above). CMRR houses three 3T scanners, two 7T scanners, and one 10.5T scanner for human subjects. 

For more information, visit [CMRR's website.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/){:target="_blank"} 

!!! tip
    3T-D is the name for the satellite 3T scanner housed at MIDB and managed by CMRR. 

## Registering with CMRR

As a new user, you will need to [register with CMRR.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/access/){:target="_blank"} Once your registration is complete, you will be given a CMRR login (username). 

!!! note
    Your CMRR login may or may not be the same as your umnID. Check it [here.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/sysadmin/database2/myview2.php?page=edit_account){:target="_blank"} 

## CMRR Resources

### Building and Magnet Access

There are various levels of access to CMRR's resources. Different trainings are required for each level. Follow the steps outlined [here.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/safety/){:target="_blank"} The following definitions are not formal but should help you decide which type of access you need:

1. **General access:** 
    * Someone who needs access to CMRR's building but not the magnets. 
2. **Magnet access:** 
    * Someone who needs card access to any of CMRR's magnets but will not be operating the scanners or be interacting with human participants (e.g., someone working with peripheral equipment or console computers). 
3. **Human research access:** 
    * Someone who is planning to be present at scans with human subjets but will not operate the scanner (e.g., study coordinators, study support staff, etc.).
4. **Phantom access:** 
    * Someone who is planning on operating the scanner to acquire data on phantoms but not human subjects. 
5. **Operator access:** 
    * Someone who is planning on operating the scanner to acquire data on human subjects. 

!!! note
    Anyone who needs human research access or operator access at a scanner is required to be CPR certified. 
 
### VPN access

If you will be transferring data from CMRR servers to MSI, then you will need access to CMRR's servers and the CMRR VPN. 

Check access:

1. Navigate to your [CMRR profile.](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/access/user/my.profile.php){:target="_blank"} If there is a button that says "Change CMRR server password" then you have access (and you might need to change your password if you don't remember what it is).

2. Log in to the CMRR VPN with your umnID and password. If you have server access but run into issues with logging on with the VPN, put in a help ticket with CMRR (help@cmrr.umn.edu). 

Request access: Put in a help ticket to CMRR (help@cmrr.umn.edu) with the subject line: CMRR VPN access. CC your supervisor and request CMRR VPN and server access. 


### Calendar access

The CMRR calendar system is used to book magnet time for projects. Every study that uses CMRR resources has a 5 digit CMRR project number (10XXX). This number is generated once the PARS application is approved.

!!! tip 
    If you are new to a project and need to be added to an existing CMRR project, contact Jon Lem with the name of your PI and the name of the project.

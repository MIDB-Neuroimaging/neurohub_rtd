There are two separate classes taught at CMRR for CMRR and MIDB users: Safety Training and Operator Training. 

Safety Training will take place at CMRR for all users. 

Operator Training (which first chair users are required to attend twice) focuses much more on the operation of the scanner itself. About half of this class is spent using the GUI of the scanner. Currently, the scanners at CMRR and MIDB use different software platforms. When you register for operator training, make sure you sign up for the training appropriate for your primary magnet: if it is 3T-D, then you need the training at MIDB. For all other 3T magnets, you need the training at CMRR.  

If you plan to work at both CMRR and MIDB, check with your PI about the most appropriate plan for your training.

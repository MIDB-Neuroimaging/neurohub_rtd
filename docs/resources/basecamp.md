# Basecamp Basics

## What Is Basecamp?

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/){:target="_blank"} is a project management application useful for monitoring projects throughout their lifetime. With Basecamp, managers can assign tasks, deliverables, and due dates to personnel on the project. These deadlines can be once, or recurring, and will send out reminders to the assigned personnel. Basecamp is also great for quick messaging and centralizing document sharing.

## Features

- **Project Management:** Basecamp offers tools for organizing projects, assigning tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking progress.
  
- **Team Collaboration:** Users can communicate with team members through messages, comments, and real-time chat.
  
- **File Sharing:** Basecamp allows users to upload and share files, documents, and media within projects.

## Client Privileges
Basecamp allows you to add people to your project as clients. Clients are able to view the message board and project status, but have reduced access to creating and managing tasks and documents. However, each document can be individually allowed for client access should they need it.
